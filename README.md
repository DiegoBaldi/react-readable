Project made with ReactJS + React-Router-v4 - Redux to manage a little "blog". In the project there is no authentication to let me focus on Redux.
The Project is build to showcase an intensive and extensive use of Redux (all-state-management)

## To Install and run

1. Clone or download the server repo at [local-backend-server](https://github.com/Utnapishtim86/reactnd-project-readable-starter)

2. Start server:

    ```bash
    node server
    ```

    with yarn
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

3. Clone or Download this repo and run:

## Challenges
* All application state is managed by the Redux store. State-based props are mapped from the store rather than stored as component state.
* Focus on composition vs inheritance.
